## Task 4.2: Information Architecture

### Screen Information Mapping

#### Main Dashboard

- **Header:** User greeting, total money across envelopes, logout
- **Primary Focus:** Category cards showing name, budget, spent, remaining, progress bar
- **Secondary:** Recent transactions list (last 5 entries)
- **Actions:** Floating "Add Transaction" button, "Add Category" button, "View All" transactions link

#### Add Transaction Modal

- **Transaction Type Tabs:** Income/Expense/Transfer (changes form fields)
- **Common Fields:** Amount, description, date picker (defaults to today)
- **Conditional Fields:**
  - Income: "Deposit to" category dropdown
  - Expense: "Spend from" category dropdown (shows remaining balance)
  - Transfer: "From" category, "To" category (validation prevents same selection)

#### Authentication Pages

- **Minimal Design:** App name as logo, essential form fields only
- **Login:** Email, password, register link
- **Register:** First name, last name, email, password, confirm password, login link

#### Transaction History

- **Dashboard Section:** Last 5 transactions with "View All" link
- **Full Page:** Comprehensive filtering (date range, category, type), search, edit/delete actions
- **Smart Display:** Color coding (red=expense, green=income), clear metadata

#### Category Detail

- **Summary Section:** Budget vs. spent vs. remaining, visual progress bar
- **Quick Actions:** Add Expense (pre-fills category), Edit Category, Delete Category
- **Transaction History:** All transactions for this specific category
- **Management:** Edit/delete individual transactions

#### Edit Category

- **Context Information:** Current balance, transaction count, creation date
- **Form Fields:** Category name, monthly budget amount
- **Smart Warnings:** Budget change impact alerts, deletion consequence warnings
- **Safe Delete:** Separate section with clear warnings about balance loss

### Navigation Flow Architecture

**Hub Model:** Dashboard serves as central navigation point with clear return paths.

**Navigation Patterns:**

- **Authentication Flow:** Login ↔ Register → Dashboard
- **Dashboard Hub:** Central point connecting to all major functions
- **Modal Returns:** All modals return to their origin screen
- **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Simple "← Back" buttons for deep screens

**Key Navigation Rules:**

- Category cards (entire card clickable) → Category Detail
- "Add Transaction" modal context-aware (pre-fills from Category Detail)
- Transaction editing returns to Transaction History page
- All delete confirmations → appropriate parent screen

## Task 4.4: Component Interactions

### Interaction Behaviors Defined

#### Button Clicks & Navigation

- **Category Cards:** Entire card clickable → Category Detail
- **Navigation Speed:** Instant transitions (no loading states for screen changes)
- **Modal Behavior:** Only close via explicit Cancel/Save buttons (not click-outside)
- **Floating Actions:** Context-aware behavior based on current screen

#### Form Submissions & Validation

- **Form Persistence:** Clear forms when switching transaction types (prevents confusion)
- **Validation Timing:** On submit only for MVP (simpler implementation, better UX)
- **Success Feedback:** Modal closes + brief toast notification
- **Error Handling:** Inline form errors, keep modal open for corrections

#### Error States & Edge Cases

- **API Errors:** Toast notifications for network issues, inline for form validation
- **Empty States:** Simple guidance text with clear next actions
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Manual "Retry" buttons (no automatic retries)
- **Critical Errors:** Persistent alert banners until resolved

#### Loading & State Management

- **Data Updates:** Wait for API responses (accuracy over speed for budget data)
- **Loading Priority:** Categories first, then transactions
- **Screen Updates:** Refresh current screen data after modal actions
- **Cross-tab Sync:** Skip for MVP (focus on single-tab experience)

### Envelope Budgeting Business Rules Enforced

- **No Overdrafts:** Insufficient balance errors prevent overspending
- **Transfer Validation:** Cannot transfer between same category
- **Balance Warnings:** Clear alerts when actions would cause negative balances
- **Delete Protection:** Warnings about money loss when deleting categories with balances

2. **Mobile-First Design:** Touch-friendly interfaces optimized for daily use
3. **Quick Daily Actions:** Most common tasks (add expense) require minimal clicks
4. **Data Accuracy:** Wait for API confirmation rather than optimistic updates
5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Simple interfaces that reveal complexity when needed

### Technical Implementation Guidance
