# Project: Budget Envelope Tracker

## Problem

Budget-conscious individuals struggle to control spending in specific categories because they can't easily track category limits, leading to overspending in discretionary areas.

## Core Features (Must Have):

- Create spending categories with budget limits
- Record transactions and assign to categories
- View remaining balance per category

## Nice-to-Have Features:

- Transfer money between categories
- Edit/delete past transactions
- Monthly budget reset
- Basic spending summaries
- Category color coding

## Standout Feature:

- Visual "envelope" interface showing budget fill levels

## Scope Boundaries:

- **In scope:** Personal expense tracking with category budgets, manual transaction entry
- **Out of scope:** Bank integration, bill reminders, multi-user accounts, mobile app

## Success Criteria:

- Users can track category spending without exceeding budgets unknowingly
- Demonstrates full-stack development skills (UI + API + Database)
- Completable in 4 weeks as portfolio project
